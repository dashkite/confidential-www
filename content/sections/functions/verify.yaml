title: verify
signature:
  - inputs: [ declaration ]
    output: [ is-valid ]
variables:
  declaration:
    type: "[`Declaration`]()"
    description: |
      Container object with for Panda-Confidential signing. Has properties `data`, `signatures`, and `signatories`.
  is-valid:
    type: "[`Boolean`]()"
    description: |
      `true` if the signatures are valid, `false` otherwise.

prose: |
  Accepts the [`Declaration`]() output of `sign` and verifies its integrity, returning `true` or `false`.  In this way, `verify` and [`sign`]() form a pair of opposing operations.

  > **Warning:** Everything needed to verify the signatures exists within a [`Declaration`](), but it is up to _you_ to verify the authenticity of the public keys within `signatories`.

      ```coffeescript
      import {confidential} from "panda-confidential"
      {verify, declaration} = confidential()
      import {receive, process} from "my-library"

      do ->
        # convert JSON to declaration
        greeting = declaration convert from: "json", receive "Alice"


        if verify greeting
          # do something with the verified data.
          process convert to: "utf8", greeting.data
        else
          throw new Error "Unable to verify data signatures."
      ```
