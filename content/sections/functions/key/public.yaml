title: key.public
signature:
  - inputs: [ key ]
    output: [ public-key ]

variables:
  key:
    type: "[`Uint8Array`]() | [`Buffer`]()"
    description: |
      Byte array representation of a key literal.
  public-key:
    type: "[`PublicKey`]()"
    description: |
      Instance of [`PublicKey`]()

prose: |
  Generates an instance of [`PublicKey`]() by wrapping `key`. Key literals must be in the form of a [`Uint8Array`]() (or its Node.js [`Buffer`]() equivalent).  You may use [`convert`]() to convert serialized key literals into the correct form.  If you provide a literal that is not [`nacl.box.publicKeyLength`]() bytes long, `key.public` throws.

  Panda-Confidential always generates _new_ public keys as part of public-private key pairs.  Please see [`EncryptionKeyPair`]() or [`SignatureKeyPair`]() for more information.

    content: |
      ```coffeescript
      import {confidential} from "panda-confidential"
      {key} = confidential()

      do ->
        # Generate a Public key from a key literal.
        key1 = key.public convert {from: "base64", to: "bytes"},
