title: hash
signature:
  - inputs: [ plaintext ]
    output: [ hash ]
variables:
  plaintext:
    type: "[`Plaintext`]()"
    description: |
      The data to be hashed.
  hash:
    type: "[`Uint8Array`]()"
    description: |
      A byte array containing the [SHA-512]() hash of _data_.

prose: |
  Convenience function that exposes the TweetNaCl.js implementation of [SHA-512]() hashing.

  `encrypt` expects its input to be an instance of `Plaintext`, a special container that keeps your data typed and formmated properly for `hash`.  To convert your data into an instance of `Plaintext`, use the static method `Plaintext.from`.

    content: |
      ```coffeescript
      import assert from "assert"
      import {confidential} from "panda-confidential"
      {hash, Plaintext} = confidential()

      do ->
        myHash = hash Plaintext.from "utf8", "Hello, World!"
        assert.equal myHash, ""
      ```
