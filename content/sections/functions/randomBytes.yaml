title: randomBytes
signature:
  inputs: [ length ]
  output: bytes
  variables:
    length:
      type: "[`Integer`]()"
      description: |
        Length of the desired output, in bytes.
    bytes:
      type: "[`Uint8Array`]() | [`Buffer`]()"
      description: |
        Array of `length` pseudo-random bytes.

prose: |
  Provides an interface produce pseudorandom bytes of cryptographic quality.  This interface is also used internally to generate keys and nonces.

  By default, this is the [TweetNaCl.js `randomBytes` implmentation](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js#random-bytes-generation), which selects the underlying interface most appropriate for a given environment.  When such an interface cannot be accessed, this function throws an error.

examples:
  - title: Using randomBytes
    content: |
      ```coffeescript
      import {confidential} from "panda-confidential"
      {randomBytes} = confidential()

      randomBytes 32
      .then (bytes) ->
      # ...
      ```
