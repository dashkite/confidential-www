title: randomBytes
signature:
  - inputs: [ length ]
    output: bytes
variables:
  length:
    type: "[`Integer`]()"
    description: |
      Length of the desired output, in bytes.
  bytes:
    type: "[`Uint8Array`]() | [`Buffer`]()"
    description: |
      Array of `length` pseudo-random bytes.

prose: |
  Provides an interface produce an array of pseudorandom bytes of cryptographic quality.  This interface is also used internally to generate keys and nonces.

  By default, this is the [TweetNaCl.js `randomBytes` implmentation](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js#random-bytes-generation), which selects the underlying interface most appropriate for a given environment.  When such an interface cannot be accessed, this function throws.

examples:
  - title: Using randomBytes
    content: |
      ```coffeescript
      import {confidential} from "panda-confidential"
      {randomBytes} = confidential()

      bytes = randomBytes 32
      ```
