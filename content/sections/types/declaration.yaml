title: Declaration
prototype: false
properties:
  data:
    type: "[`Uint8Array`]()"
    description: |
      The data that has been signed.
  signatures:
    type: "[`Array`]() of [`Uint8Array`]()"
    description: |
      List of signatures. Each is generated by signing `data` with a given signatory's private key.
  signatories:
    type: "[`Array`]() of [`Uint8Array`]()"
    description: |
      List of public keys. Each matches the corresponding signature in `signatures`.  These keys identify the signatories who used their private key to sign `data` and can be used to validate that matching signature.

  The return value for [`sign`]().

  Declarations are self-contained entities that have everything you need to check their integrity. When passed to [`verify`](), that function matches all the `signatories` to the `signatures` and validates the [digital signature]().

  You may serialize a `Declaration` using [`convert`]().

  While a Declaration can be verified to be internally self-consistent, it is up to you to verify the public keys belong to whoever claims to have sent the data.
