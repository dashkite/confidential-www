title: Key
prototype: false
prose: |
  Base class for all keys in Panda-Confidential.

  `Key` is a wrapper for the given key, formmated to be ready for use in TweetNaCl.js functions, along with a type label to ensure correct application.

  `Key` has helper methods to manage its data, summarized below. Please see the relevant section for more details.

  - `to`: instance method to return formatted internal data. `to` returns the key itself, in whichever format you request.
  - `isKind`: static method providing a boolean prototype chain check for `Key`

  Typically, you will not directly use this class. But all other keys inherit its interface.

properties:
  key:
    type: "[`Uint8Array`]()"
    description: |
      The value of this key.

staticMethods:
  isKind:
    signatures:
      - inputs: [ value ]
        output: is-key
    variables:
      value:
        type: Value
        description: |
          A value to be tested.
      is-key:
        type: "[`Boolean`]()"
        description: |
          `true` if `value` is an instance of `Key` or has one in its prototype chain, `false` otherwise.
    prose: |
      Type check method to determine if the input `value` is an instance of `Key` or contains `Key` in its prototype chain.  Returns `true` or `false`.

instanceMethods:
  to:
    signatures:
      - inputs: [ hint ]
        output: encoded-key
    variables:
      hint:
        type: "[`String`]()"
        description: |
          name that specifies the `to` conversion hint.
      encoded-key:
        type: "[`String`]() | [`Uint8Array`]()"
        description: |
          A data representation of a key
    prose:  |
      Converts this instance's value into the form specified by `hint`.

      `Key` is a simple wrapper for the given key, so `to` returns the key itself, in whichever format you request.

      #### Supported Hints
      - `bytes`: A byte array, specifically [`Uint8Array`]()
      - `utf8`: A [`String`]() with [UTF-8 encoding]()
      - `base64`: A [`String`]() with [Base64 encoding]()
      - `safe-base64`: A [`String`]() with [URL-Safe Base64 encoding]()

      Specifying an unsupported conversion throws.
