prose: |
  Base class for all keys in Panda-Confidential. It stores a decoded key ready for use in TweetNaCl.js functions, along with a type label to ensure correct application.

  You may use [`convert`]() to serialize the value `key`.

  This class is not directly part of the Panda-Confidential interface, but its descendants all share its interface.
