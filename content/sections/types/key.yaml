title: Key
prototype: false
prose: |
  Base class for all keys in Panda-Confidential. It stores a decoded key ready for use in TweetNaCl.js functions, along with a type label to ensure correct application.

  This class contains a method interface for managing the serialization of `Key`s.

  This class is not directly part of the Panda-Confidential interface, but its descendants inherit its interface.

properties:
  key:
    type: "[`Uint8Array`]()"
    description: |
      The value of this key.

methods:
  to:
    signature:
      - inputs: [ format ]
        output: encoded-key
    variables:
      to:
        type: "[`String`]()"
        description: |
          name that specifies the output encoding.
      encoded-key:
        type: "[`String`]() | [`Uint8Array`]()"
        description: |
          The key in an encoded form for transport or storage.
    prose:  |
      Outputs this instance's value in the form specified in `format`.

      #### Supported Types
      - `bytes`: A byte array, specifically [`Uint8Array`]() or its equivalent in Node.js [`Buffer`]()
      - `utf8`: A [`String`]() with [UTF-8 encoding]()
      - `base64`: A [`String`]() with [Base64 encoding]()
      - `safe-base64`: A [`String`]() with [URL-Safe Base64 encoding]()
      - `object`: An [`Object`] with fields containing values as they are stored internally, as byte arrays.

      Specifying an unsupported conversion throws.

  from:
    signature:
      - inputs: [ format, data ]
        output: key
    variables:
      to:
        type: "[`String`]()"
        description: |
          name that specifies the input format.
      data:
        type: "[`String`]() | [`Uint8Array`]() | [`Buffer`]() | [`Object`]()"
        description: |
          A representation of the data of a key.
      key:
        type: "[`Key`]()"
        description: |
          The key in an encoded form for transport or storage.
    prose: |
      Returns an instanciated `Delcaration` based on the value of `data`.

      `format` is a hint that tells `from` how convert the value into `Key`'s internal reprentation.

      #### Supported Types
      - `bytes`: A byte array, specifically [`Uint8Array`]() or its equivalent in Node.js [`Buffer`]()
      - `utf8`: A [`String`]() with [UTF-8 encoding]()
      - `base64`: A [`String`]() with [Base64 encoding]()
      - `safe-base64`: A [`String`]() with [URL-Safe Base64 encoding]()
      - `object`: An [`Object`]

      Specifying an unsupported conversion throws.

      If `format` conflicts with `data`'s type (ex: `data` is a byte array, while `format` is "string"), `from` thows.

        output: is-key
    variables:

        description: |
          A value to be tested.
      is-key:
        type: "[`Boolean`]()"
        description: |
          `true` if `value` has the `Key` in its prototype chain, `false` otherwise.
    prose: |
      Type check method to determine if the input `value` is an instance of `Key` or has inherited from one in its prototype.  Returns `true` or `false`.
