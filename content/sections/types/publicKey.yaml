title: PublicKey
prototype: "[`Key`]()"
prose: |
  One of the two key types in a [`KeyPair`](), used to perform public-key cryptography.

  > Note: This key serves to identify the holder and may be shared widely.

  Because this type extends [`Key`](), you may:
  - manage `PublicKey` serialization through the `to` and `from` methods.
  - check if this key is _any_ type of instanciated [`Key`]() through the `isKind` method.

  This class adds to the method interface with:
  - `isType`: type check specifically for `PublicKey`

  Note that this key type cannot be created directly, but rather through the creation of an [`EncryptionKeyPair`]() or [`SignatureKeyPair`]().  Further, while both of those key pairs contain instances of `PublicKey`, encryption and signing keys in Panda-Confidential cannot interoperate.

          A value to be tested.

        type: "[`Boolean`]()"
        description: |
          `true` if `value` is an instance of [`PublicKey`](), `false` otherwise.
    prose: |
      Type check method to determine if the input `value` is an instance of `PublicKey`.  Returns `true` or `false`.
