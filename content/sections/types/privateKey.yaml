title: PrivateKey
prototype: "[`Key`]()"
prose: |
  One of the two key types in a [`KeyPair`](), used to perform public-key cryptography.

  > **Warning:** This key must remain secret for the public-key cryptography to be effective.

  Because this type extends [`Key`](), you may:
  - manage `PrivateKey` serialization through the `to` method.
  - check if this key is _any_ type of instanciated [`Key`]() through the `isKind` method.

  This class adds to the interface with:
  - `from`: static method to instanciate a `PrivateKey` from serialized data.
  - `isType`: static method to type check specifically on `PrivateKey`

  Note that this key type cannot be created directly, but rather through the creation of an [`EncryptionKeyPair`]() or [`SignatureKeyPair`]().  Further, while both of those key pairs contain instances of `PrivateKey`, encryption and signing keys in Panda-Confidential cannot interoperate.

          A value to be tested.
      is-private-key:
        type: "[`Boolean`]()"
        description: |
          `true` if `value` is an instance of [`PrivateKey`](), `false` otherwise.
    prose: |
      Type checks on `value` to see if it is an instance of `PrivateKey`.  Returns `true` or `false`.

    signature:
      - inputs: [ hint, data ]
        output: key
    variables:
      hint:
        type: "[`String`]()"
        description: |
          name that specifies the input hint.
      data:
        type: "[`String`]() | [`Uint8Array`]() | [`Buffer`]()"
        description: |
          A representation of the data of a key.
      key:
        type: "[`PrivateKey`]()"
        description: |
          An instanciated `PrivateKey`.
    prose: |
      Returns an instanciated `PrivateKey` based on the value of `data`.

      `hint` tells `from` how convert the value into `PrivateKey`'s internal reprentation.

      #### Supported Types
      - `bytes`: A byte array, specifically [`Uint8Array`]() or its equivalent in Node.js [`Buffer`]()
      - `utf8`: A [`String`]() with [UTF-8 encoding]()
      - `base64`: A [`String`]() with [Base64 encoding]()
      - `safe-base64`: A [`String`]() with [URL-Safe Base64 encoding]()

      Specifying an unsupported conversion throws.

      If `hint` conflicts with `data`'s type (ex: `data` is a byte array, while `hint` is "string"), `from` thows.
