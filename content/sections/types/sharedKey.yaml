title: SharedKey
prototype: "[`Key`]()"
prose: |
  A special key type used to perform [asymmetric encryption]().  This key is derived algorithmically from one [`PublicKey`]() and one [`PrivateKey`]().  That allows two people to, independently, generate the same _shared_ secret key and conduct authenticated encryption/decryption.

  > **Warning:** This key must remain secret for the encryption to be effective.

  Because this type extends [`Key`](), you may:
  - manage `SharedKey` serialization through the `to` and `from` methods.
  - check if this key is _any_ type of instanciated [`Key`]() through the `isKind` method.

  This class adds to the interface with:
  - `create`: static method to generate a shared key suitable for [asymmetric encryption]()
  - `isType`: static method to type check specifically on `SharedKey`

      shared-key:
        type: "`SharedKey`"
        description: |
          An instance of `SharedKey`.
    prose: |
      Generates a new `SharedKey` by algorithmically combinding `public-key` and `private-key`.

        description: |
          `true` if `value` is an instance of [`SharedKey`](), `false` otherwise.
    prose: |
      Type checks on `value` to see if it is an instance of `SharedKey`.  Returns `true` or `false`.
