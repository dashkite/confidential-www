title: SharedKey
prototype: "[`Key`]()"
prose: |
  A special key type used to perform [asymmetric encryption]().  This key is derived algorithmically from one [`PublicKey`]() and one [`PrivateKey`]().  That allows two people to, independently, generate the same _shared_ secret key and conduct authenticated encryption/decryption.

  > **Warning:** This key must remain secret for the encryption to be effective.

  Because this type extends [`Key`](), you may:
  - manage `SharedKey` serialization through the `to` method.
  - check if this key is _any_ type of instanciated [`Key`]() through the `isKind` method.

  This class adds to the interface with:
  - `from`: static method to instanciate a `SharedKey` from serialized data.
  - `create`: static method to generate a shared key suitable for [asymmetric encryption]()
  - `isType`: static method to type check specifically on `SharedKey`

    variables:
      public-key:
        type: "[`PublicKey`]()"
        description: |
          Public key suitable for encryption.
      private-key:
        type: "[`PrivateKey`]()"
        description: |
          Private key suitable for encryption.
      key-pair:
        type: "[`EncryptionKeyPair`]()"
        description: |
          Key pair suitable for encryption.
      shared-key:
        type: "`SharedKey`"
        description: |
          An instance of `SharedKey`.
    prose: |
      Generates a new `SharedKey` by algorithmically combinding `public-key` and `private-key`.

  from:
    signature:
      - inputs: [ hint, data ]
        output: key
    variables:
      hint:
        type: "[`String`]()"
        description: |
          name that specifies the input hint.
      data:
        type: "[`String`]() | [`Uint8Array`]() | [`Buffer`]()"
        description: |
          A representation of the data of a key.
      key:
        type: "[`SharedKey`]()"
        description: |
          An instanciated `SharedKey`.
    prose: |
      Returns an instanciated `SharedKey` based on the value of `data`.

      `hint` tells `from` how convert the value into `SharedKey`'s internal reprentation.

      #### Supported Types
      - `bytes`: A byte array, specifically [`Uint8Array`]() or its equivalent in Node.js [`Buffer`]()
      - `utf8`: A [`String`]() with [UTF-8 encoding]()
      - `base64`: A [`String`]() with [Base64 encoding]()
      - `safe-base64`: A [`String`]() with [URL-Safe Base64 encoding]()

      Specifying an unsupported conversion throws.

      If `hint` conflicts with `data`'s type (ex: `data` is a byte array, while `hint` is "string"), `from` thows.

  isType:
    signature:
      - inputs: [ value ]
        output: is-shared-key
    variables:
      value:
        type: Value
        description: |
          A value to be tested.
      is-shared-key:
        type: "[`Boolean`]()"
        description: |
          `true` if `value` is an instance of [`SharedKey`](), `false` otherwise.
    prose: |
      Type checks on `value` to see if it is an instance of `SharedKey`.  Returns `true` or `false`.
