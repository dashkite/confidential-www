title: SharedKey
prototype: "[`Key`]()"
properties: {}
prose: |
  A special key type used to perform [asymmetric encryption]().  This key is derived algorithmically from one [`PublicKey`]() and one [`PrivateKey`]().  That allows two people to, remotely, generate the same _shared_ secret key and conduct authenticated encryption/decryption.

  Generate an instance of this key with [`key.shared`]().
