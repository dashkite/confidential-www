title: PrivateKey
prototype: "[`Key`]()"
prose: |
  One of the two key types in a [`KeyPair`](), used to perform public-key cryptography.

  > **Warning:** This key must remain secret for the public-key cryptography to be effective.

  `PrivateKey` extends [`Key`](), so it inherits its inteface: (Please see that class for more details.)
  - `to`: instance method to return formatted internal data. `to` returns the key itself, in whichever format you request.
  - `isKind`: static method providing a boolean prototype chain check for `Key`

  `PrivateKey` extends that interface with:
  - `from`: static method to hydrate an instance of `PrivateKey` from data
  - `isType`: static method providing a boolean type-check for `PrivateKey`

  Note that this key type cannot be created directly, but rather through the creation of an [`EncryptionKeyPair`]() or [`SignatureKeyPair`]().  Further, while both types of key pairs contain instances of `PrivateKey`, encryption and signing keys in Panda-Confidential cannot interoperate.

        description: |
          `true` if `value` is an instance of [`PrivateKey`](), `false` otherwise.
    prose: |
      Type checks on `value` to see if it is an instance of `PrivateKey`.  Returns `true` or `false`.

    variables:
      hint:
        type: "[`String`]()"
        description: |
          name that specifies the `from` conversion hint.
      data:
        type: "[`String`]() | [`Uint8Array`]()"
        description: |
          A data representation of a private key.
      key:
        type: "[`PrivateKey`]()"
        description: |
          Instance of [`PrivateKey`](), hydrated by the input `data`.
    prose: |
      Hydrates an instance of `PrivateKey` from given `data`.

      `hint` informs `from` how convert `data` into `PrivateKey`'s internal reprentation.

      #### Supported Hints
      - `bytes`: A byte array, specifically [`Uint8Array`]()
      - `utf8`: A [`String`]() with [UTF-8 encoding]()
      - `base64`: A [`String`]() with [Base64 encoding]()
      - `safe-base64`: A [`String`]() with [URL-Safe Base64 encoding]()

      Specifying an unsupported conversion throws.

      If `hint` conflicts with `data`'s type (ex: `data` is a byte array, while `hint` is "string"), `from` thows.
